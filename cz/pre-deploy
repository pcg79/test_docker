# This script is intended to house any actions you'd like to take before the app
# has been successfully deployed. It's run once per server. If it exits nonzero
# on any of the servers, deployment will be halted. As such, you shouldn't be
# doing things that mutate any kind of global state here, as you'd leave the
# app in a dirty state.
