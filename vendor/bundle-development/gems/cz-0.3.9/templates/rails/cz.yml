# who should be able to work with this app's vault or deploy the app. You'll
# need to get the latest public keys for each developer in in this list in
# order to encrypt secrets for the app. Don't worry, `cz vault` commands will

  # We've included the DevX team here, as well. REMEMBER: UNLESS SOMEONE CAN
  # DECRYPT YOUR APPLICATION'S VAULT, THEY CAN'T DEPLOY YOUR APPLICATION. While
  # you may not want everyone in the company to be on this list, if you don't at
  # least include a few folks besides yourself here, you're voluntarily reducing
  # your app's "bus factor".
